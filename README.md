# time_clock_rust
This is a reimagining of the world famous [time_clock](https://github.com/realcooltrev/time_clock) project, which was  
initially written in jBASIC for my final project in a jBASE course that I took  
in 2017.

Since I have grown as programmer since then, I thought that I would like to go  
back and improve upon what was originally written back then. However, jBASE  
requires a license, which I don't want to buy, so I decided to rewrite this  
program in another language. And what better programming language than the one  
that I currently very interested in learning, Rust!
